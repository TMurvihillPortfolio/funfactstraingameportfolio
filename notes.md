### Interesting Facts
- Electric locomotive is powered by electricity in one of two ways: an overhead pickup or through a third rail. The first one was patented in 1890 by Jean Jacques Heilmann and it crossed from paper to reality in 1893. This type of locomotive has higher performance and lower operational cost. They are also much lesser pollutant that steam and diesel locomotives. French TGV, which is electric, holds world record for the fastest train with wheels with speed 574.8km/h.

- The modern age of trains begun in early 1800s after the initial patent of James Watt for stationary steam engine expired.
- Today 40% of world’s freight cargo is transported via trains, and that number continues to grow with each year.
- Early pioneers of train development were James Watt, Oliver Evans, Matthew Murray, Richard Trevithick and George Stephenson. Their innovations enabled the rise of the modern train history.
- Total area of contact between train wheels and rail is little larger than one silver dollar.
- American first steam locomotive was imported from England in 1830. Their first American build train was built later during same year.
- First railway in Great Britain was made between 1603 and October 1604 as a simple “wagonway”. Modern railways came in 1800s.

- By 1840, United States had 60 different railroads in 26 states, with combined length of 4500 km.
- WW1 and WW2 could not become so big and long lasting without the help of railway networks and heavy industrial trains.
- Trains are one of the most eco-friendly ways you can travel.
- Heaviest train ever recorded weighted 95,000 tonnes! This freight train from Australia was 7.3 kilometers long and had the weight of 27 thousand fully grown elephants.
- U.S. embraced four time zones only after trains enabled fast travel across the continent.
- Currently U.S. has less than 170,000 miles of railways, but in 1916 they had over 254 thousand!
- Maglev trains can reach speeds of over 550 km/h, but by the year 2020 they will most probably come close to 800 km/h.
- Current speed record for trains is held by French TGV bullet train. He reached the speed of 584km per hour and then braked for 16 kilometers before it managed to stop.
- First commercial steam train (Stephenson’s “Rocket”) managed to reach the speed of 96 kilometers per hour in 1830.
