### Tech -- React with material-ui, react-router, JSS, classes, setState, JSON (localStorage)

This fun little train game was created to demonstrate React skills. Please note that my speciality is implementation, not design -- enjoy!

#### How to play:
- open 'Train operations' menu on left side
- purchase a locomotive
- select a contract from 'contract offers' on 'train operations' menu
- accept train and then start train
- while you wait for train to complete it's run, go to "catch passengers" on top menu to earn extra $$$
- when you have earned enough money, purchase another train (limit 3)
- game is complete when you have earned $2000
